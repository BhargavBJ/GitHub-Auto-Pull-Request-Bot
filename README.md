# GitHub-Auto-Pull-Request-Bot 🚀

## Introduction 🎯

Recruiters often don't focus on the specific projects you have worked on, but rather the activity and frequency of contributions displayed on your GitHub profile. A higher number of commits and pull requests can showcase your dedication, engagement with development, and ability to contribute consistently to projects. 

The **GitHub-Auto-Pull-Request-Bot** is an automated solution designed to help you maintain active contributions on GitHub by automatically generating pull requests. The bot creates random commits to your repository, enabling frequent updates and pull requests without manual intervention, ensuring that your GitHub activity remains visible and updated. 🔄

## Features ✨

- **Automatic Pull Request Generation** 🤖: The bot creates pull requests automatically based on predefined configurations.
- **Random Commit Content** 🔀: Each commit contains randomly generated sentences, ensuring variety and constant activity.
- **Customizable Frequency** ⏱️: You can configure the bot to create a specified number of pull requests per day.
- **GitHub API Integration** 🔗: Uses GitHub's API to automate pull request creation and repository interactions.
- **Logging** 📜: The bot logs its activity, allowing you to track every commit, PR creation, and any errors encountered.
